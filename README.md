# CMP 276 Assignment 3 Website

The website I made is called "All About Asad" and it is all about my pet cat Asad. It provides insights to his History, Information, Lifstyle & Hobbies, and fun facts about him.

The tech stack I used to develop this website is HTML and CSS.

I chose the MIT License for my repository to protect my intellectual property while fostering collaboration, as it allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute the code, ensuring a balance between openness and clarity in licensing terms.
